Armstrong Number Determination in C

📌 Overview

This project is a simple C program that determines whether a given number is an Armstrong Number (also known as a Narcissistic Number). An Armstrong number of 'n' digits is a number where the sum of its digits raised to the power of 'n' equals the number itself.

📖 What is an Armstrong Number?

A number is considered an Armstrong number if:

Examples:

153 → 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153 ✅ (Armstrong Number)

9474 → 9⁴ + 4⁴ + 7⁴ + 4⁴ = 9474 ✅ (Armstrong Number)

123 → 1³ + 2³ + 3³ ≠ 123 ❌ (Not an Armstrong Number)

🛠️ How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter a number.

It calculates the number of digits in the number.

It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.

It compares the sum with the original number.

If they match, it prints that the number is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it is not.
